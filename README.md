All of these e2s are pretty much in some usable state, weither you want to learn something new or not, also, some may or may not have instructions, i dont have the time to do them so good luck, i dont want to be the typical person that says "those are minge e2s, figure them out yourself" but most of them are just spawn and then right click with either the phys/grav gun or crowbar

I really dont care what you do with them, want to copy and paste entire sections to get something to work? Be my guest, thats what i did

I will likely never touch e2 again, so as a final goodbye im uploading the ones that are in some working state, unfinished or not, optimized or not
