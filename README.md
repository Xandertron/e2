All of these e2s are pretty much in some usable state, weither you want to learn something new or not

I really dont care what you do with them, want to copy and paste entire sections to get something to work? Be my guest, thats what i did

I will likely never touch e2 again, so as a final goodbye im uploading the ones that are in some working state, unfinished or not, optimized or not
